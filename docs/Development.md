### Combat

---

Lets try to make a script that attacks a man.

![img_7.png](img_7.png)

To attack an npc we'll have to look into our Rs2Npc utility class.


```java
Rs2Npc.attack("man")
```

Our example script should look like this now.

```java
public class ExampleScript extends Script {
    public static double version = 1.0;

    public boolean run(ExampleConfig config) {
        Microbot.enableAutoRunOn = false;
        mainScheduledFuture = scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
            if (!super.run()) return;
            try {

                long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

                //SCRIPT CODE COMES HERE

                long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
                long totalTime = endTime - startTime;
                System.out.println("Total time for loop " + totalTime);

            } catch (Exception ex) {
                System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
            }
        }, 0, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void shutdown() {
        super.shutdown();
    }
}
```

The script should now attack the man
